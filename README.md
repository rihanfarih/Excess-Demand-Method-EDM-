# Excess Demand Method EDM
This repository contains the implementation and research of the Excess Demand Method (EDM) for solving the Transportation Problem (TP), a classic issue in operations research. The goal is to minimize the total transportation cost of delivering goods from various suppliers to multiple consumers.


## Introduction
The Transportation Problem (TP) focuses on minimizing the cost of transporting commodities from multiple suppliers to consumers. This project implements a new approach called the Excess Demand Method (EDM), which has been shown to provide a better Initial Basic Feasible Solution (IBFS) compared to traditional methods such as the North-West Corner Method (NWM), Least Cost Method (LCM), and Vogel's Approximation Method (VAM).

## Features
* **Efficient Calculation**: Provides an efficient way to compute the Initial Basic Feasible Solution (IBFS) for transportation problems.
* **Comparison with Other Methods**: Includes comparisons with 7 other methods: NWM, LCM, VAM, TDM1, TOCM-MT, JHM, and BCE.
* **65 Test Cases**: Tested on 65 numerical problems, demonstrating improved performance in transportation cost minimization.
