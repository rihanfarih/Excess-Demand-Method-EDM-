# Excess Demand Method EDM
This repository contains the implementation and research of the Excess Demand Method (EDM) for solving the Transportation Problem (TP), a classic issue in operations research. The goal is to minimize the total transportation cost of delivering goods from various suppliers to multiple consumers.


## Introduction
The Transportation Problem (TP) focuses on minimizing the cost of transporting commodities from multiple suppliers to consumers. This project implements a new approach called the Excess Demand Method (EDM), which has been shown to provide a better Initial Basic Feasible Solution (IBFS) compared to Supply Selection Method (SSM), Bilqis Chastine Erma method (BCE), Total Opportunity Cost Matrix - Minimal Total (TOCM-MT), Vogel's Approximation Method (VAM), and Juman and Hoque's Method (JHM). 

## Features
* **Efficient Calculation**: Provides an efficient way to compute the Initial Basic Feasible Solution (IBFS) for transportation problems.
* **Comparison with Other Methods**: Includes comparisons with 6 other methods: VAM,JHM,TOCM-MT,BCE and SSM.
* **32 Test Cases**: Tested on 32 numerical problems, demonstrating improved performance in transportation cost minimization.

| **BCE**    | 21                 | 65,63                      |
| **SSM** | 22                 | 68,75                      |
| **EDM**     | **27**             | **84,38**                  |

## **Results**

The **Excess Demand Method (EDM)** led to better total transportation costs in **27 out of 32** numerical problems when compared to the other seven methods. This demonstrates **EDMâ€™s** efficiency in achieving optimal solutions.
